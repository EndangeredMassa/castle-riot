## Castle Riot

A casual multiplayer game of Guards and Thieves is afoot! (It's way cooler than cops and robbers!)

As a thief, sneak around trying to steal paintings and get out a door! Watch out: carrying the painting makes you slower. You can press d to drop it and run!

As a guard, use your torch to find thieves and capture them!

Play for fame, glory, and maybe the high score!
